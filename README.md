# NewsApp

Welcome to the News App. This is a News app :)

To get started, clone or download this repo into a virtual or live server, then open it in terminal and type:

```
npm install
```

After you have done that, go to [https://newsapi.org/](https://newsapi.org/) and sign up for an account to get a news api key. This is a free to use key up to 500 requests a day, so it should be plenty for messing around with the app.

When you have finished getting the key, rename the `configExample.json` file to `config.json` and replace the placeholder text inside the `newsApiKey` field with your new key.

This should get you all set up to mess around with the app. Give it a try by visiting the `index.html` page!
